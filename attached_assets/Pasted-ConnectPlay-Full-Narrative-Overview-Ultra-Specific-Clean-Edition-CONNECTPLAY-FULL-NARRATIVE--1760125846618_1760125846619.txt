ConnectPlay — Full Narrative Overview 
(Ultra–Specific Clean Edition) 
CONNECTPLAY — FULL NARRATIVE OVERVIEW (ULTRA–SPECIFIC CLEAN EDITION) 
ConnectPlay is a three-sided platform built to bridge universities, industry professionals, and students into one seamless, interconnected ecosystem. It functions as an operational framework where universities can give their students access to verified guest speakers, curated educational content, and professional development experiences. For professionals, ConnectPlay provides a structured way to mentor, speak, and monetize their expertise. For students, it offers a secure, code-gated environment to engage directly with leaders in their fields. The following overview walks through every section of the platform in a narrative style, describing not just what users see but how each component behaves, interacts, and transitions between stages. 
PUBLIC LANDING (HOME) When users first visit ConnectPlay, they are greeted by a clean and modern interface. The logo appears in the upper-left corner, establishing brand consistency, while the top navigation bar extends to the right, showing “Universities,” “Industry Professionals,” “About,” “Contact,” “Student Login,” and “Admin Login.” Hovering over any navigation item slightly darkens its color, and the “Admin Login” button adds a faint shadow to emphasize interactivity. At the center of the homepage, a bold headline reads “Connecting Universities with Industry Experts.” The phrase “Industry Experts” appears in a distinct electric blue, visually highlighting ConnectPlay’s mission to link academia and real-world experience. A subheading beneath explains the goal clearly: “The premier platform for academic-industry partnerships—helping universities manage student access, book verified guest speakers, and measure engagement outcomes.” 
Beneath this hero section are three featured cards representing ConnectPlay’s core user types: “For Universities,” “For Industry Professionals,” and “For Students.” Each card has uniform height and subtle shadows to maintain design balance. Hovering over a card causes it to rise slightly with a smooth transition. Each card features an icon, a short description, and a call-to-action button. For example, “For Universities” invites institutions to partner with ConnectPlay to provide student access to verified speakers. “For Industry Professionals” encourages experts to join the network, while “For Students” directs learners to use their access codes to join their university’s network. Below these, a four-step “How ConnectPlay Works” section outlines the process: universities partner with the platform, access codes are issued, students use those codes to join, and universities then track engagement. Finally, a “Complete Platform” section highlights ConnectPlay’s advantages—verified speakers, easy scheduling, and measurable results. The homepage closes with a minimalist footer containing essential navigation links.
UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS When a university representative selects “University Partnerships,” they are taken to a page that explains the different partnership levels. The page opens with a large heading that reads “University Partnerships,” followed by a subheading explaining how the platform 
enables scalable access to real-world experts. Three visually balanced cards showcase different partnership plans: “Program Partnership,” “School Partnership,” and “University Partnership.” Each card outlines its benefits. The Program Partnership offers up to five guest speakers per semester and basic reporting. The School Partnership—highlighted as “Most Popular”—includes unlimited speakers, analytics, and a dedicated account manager. The University Partnership plan provides enterprise-level integration with custom reporting and API access. Each plan features a blue “Custom Pricing” button that, when clicked, anchors the page to the request form below. 
The Request Partnership Demo form appears below these tiers. It includes fields for full name, title, university name, email address (which must end in .edu), program size, goals and objectives, and implementation timeline. Inline validation ensures all required fields are filled, and errors appear in subtle red text beneath the input fields. After submission, the page transitions smoothly to a confirmation screen displaying a centered green checkmark and a thank-you message. The user can either return to the homepage or continue to preview the University Dashboard by selecting the primary “Continue to Preview Dashboard” button. 
UNIVERSITY DASHBOARD PREVIEW Selecting “Continue to Preview Dashboard” brings the user into the University Dashboard preview. At the top of this page, a deep red gradient banner greets the user with the name of their university and college, such as “The Ohio State University — Fisher College of Business.” A smaller line welcomes them back by name, simulating a real administrator’s greeting. The main dashboard is divided into key performance tiles showing “Active Students,” “Speakers Booked,” “Active Cohorts,” and “Average Engagement.” These values display example data that, in a live system, would update dynamically based on real metrics. Beneath this, four primary tabs—Overview, Guest Speakers, Student Management, and Access Codes—allow users to navigate between functions. The Overview page displays two content cards: one listing recent speaker events and another summarizing active student cohorts. Each section includes a management button linking to more detailed views. A sidebar on the left contains navigation for Dashboard, My Speakers, Content Library, Events, Messages, Speaker Connect, and Settings. 
INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS — APPLICATION PROCESS When an individual clicks “Become a Speaker,” they are guided through a structured three-step application. The first page, titled “Basic Information,” prompts them to fill in their name, email, job title, company, industry, location, and professional bio. There is also an option to “Quick Setup with LinkedIn,” which can autofill much of this data. After clicking “Next: Speaking Details,” the user proceeds to a second screen where they select their areas of expertise from a list of topics including Leadership, Media Relations, Entrepreneurship, and others. They also input their speaking fee, contact information, and any special requirements. The third page, “Review and Submit,” displays a summary of their input for verification. Submitting the form
leads to a success page that reads “Application Submitted!” and provides options to either return home or continue to preview their professional dashboard. 
SPEAKER DASHBOARD PREVIEW After submission, the professional sees a preview of their personalized Speaker Dashboard. A dark header greets them by name and title, for example, “Welcome back, Dr. Emily Carter — Senior Director, Global Partnerships at Nike.” Key metrics such as Total Revenue, Content Sales, Speaking Events, and Average Rating are displayed in tiles along the top of the page, with placeholder numbers representing what would eventually be live, dynamic data. The dashboard contains four sections—Overview, Speaking Events, Content Studio, and Earnings. The Overview tab shows quick actions like “View Calendar” and “Create Content,” as well as a recent activity feed listing content purchases, speaking engagements, and other updates. The Speaking Events tab lists upcoming university sessions and includes details like dates, formats (virtual or in-person), and event fees. The Content Studio section displays total content, total views, and total revenue. It also includes buttons to “Start Creating Content” or “Create New,” both of which lead to a page where the speaker can upload materials, set pricing, and categorize their work. The Earnings tab provides income summaries and transaction histories, showing how much revenue came from speaking and content sales. Selecting “View Detailed Analytics” opens a Recruiter Tools page with filters and analytics, allowing speakers to see which universities engage with their materials and to request AI-powered recommendations for potential collaborations. 
STUDENT ACCESS AND DASHBOARD Students enter the platform by selecting “Enter Access Code” on the homepage. A clean, centered page prompts them to input the unique access code provided by their university. Once validated, the page updates to confirm successful verification and invites them to complete their profile. The profile page includes fields for name, email, major, graduation year, and student ID. After submission, students are greeted with a welcome message and can access their personalized dashboard. The dashboard design mirrors that of the other roles but uses a blue-accented theme. It begins with a banner greeting, followed by the student’s university name and major. A highlighted “Connect with a Speaker” box encourages students to input special speaker codes to connect directly with professionals. Below this, content is organized into sections titled “Upcoming For You,” “Recommended Content,” and “Sponsored Opportunities.” Each section displays personalized suggestions based on the student’s activity, program, and interests. 
The “My Speakers” tab allows students to manage connections. A search bar at the top lets them filter by name or organization. Two buttons, “Upcoming” and “Past Speakers,” toggle between current and previous engagements. The Content Library section acts as a curated educational store, featuring a search bar and filters for type, price, and topic. Each piece of content includes a thumbnail, title, description, and purchase button that reflects real-time pricing. The Events page focuses on “Ask Me Anything” sessions where students can RSVP to virtual Q&As; hosted by professionals. Students can view sessions they have registered for under “My RSVPs” and their completed sessions under “My AMAs.” Unlike industry professionals, students cannot host events, and therefore the “Host AMA”
button is hidden from their interface. 
MESSAGES, SPEAKER CONNECT, AND SETTINGS The Messages section functions as a modern chat system with real-time messaging capability. Conversations appear in a left-hand sidebar, and the selected thread expands into a chat window on the right. Each message shows sender names and timestamps, while unread messages are marked with a small blue dot. Users can report, block, or leave conversations through an options menu. The Speaker Connect tab allows students to search for industry professionals or connect directly using speaker codes. The interface includes a search bar, filter categories, and professional cards displaying titles, companies, and focus areas. The Settings section lets users customize their profiles, change notification preferences, and manage their accounts. It also includes a “Danger Zone” area with the option to delete an account, protected by a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions. 
Throughout the entire platform, ConnectPlay maintains strict design, accessibility, and functionality standards. Dummy data serves only as placeholders, replaced dynamically with personalized information once accounts are live. Role-based visibility ensures that students only see what applies to them, while professionals and universities have administrative access specific to their needs. Every interactive component is responsive, visually balanced, and optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. With its emphasis on professionalism, user experience, and cross-functional connection, ConnectPlay transforms how universities, professionals, and students engage in the shared pursuit of career development and education.
