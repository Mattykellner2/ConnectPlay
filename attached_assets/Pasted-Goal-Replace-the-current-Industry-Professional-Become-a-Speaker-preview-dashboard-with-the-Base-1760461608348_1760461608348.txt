Goal: Replace the current Industry Professional (“Become a Speaker”) preview dashboard with the Base44 design and interactions, in a single edit. Keep everything responsive. Use placeholder (dummy) data that will later hydrate from the logged-in user.

0) Routing & layout

Create/replace the speaker dashboard at /speakers/dashboard with this structure:

SpeakerDashboardLayout (shell)

left sidebar nav (persistent)

top profile header (persistent)

top tab bar (persistent): Overview · Speaking Events · Content Studio · Earnings

tab content area (switches by route or internal state)

If the current route differs, add a redirect from the existing “continue to preview dashboard” route to /speakers/dashboard.

1) Sidebar (add and make functional)

Left column (sticky) matching Base44 spacing/weights.

Top: ConnectPlay logo → clicking routes to /speakers/dashboard.

Section: Navigation

Overview → shows Overview tab

Speaking Events

Content Studio

Earnings

Messages

Settings

Active item highlighted with soft background and bold label.

Icons: use the same icon family sitewide (e.g., Lucide). Size 18–20px.

2) Profile header (at top of content, always visible)

Dark, subtle gradient container with rounded-xl and soft shadow (Base44 style).

Left: profile photo (circle, 64–72px), “Welcome back, {user.fullName}” as H3/H2 weight, and a 2nd-line subtitle ({user.title} at {user.company} if available).

Small green pill badge: Industry Expert (static UI, data-driven later).

Right: “Create Content” button (primary, with plus icon). Wire to /speakers/content/new (temporary route OK).

3) KPI cards row (same across tabs)

Show 4 cards with larger icons that match Base44:

Total Revenue (green money icon)

Content Sales (book/doc icon)

Speaking Events (microphone icon)

Average Rating (star icon)

Card rules:

Same card height, rounded-xl, soft shadow, icon in a soft colored badge (24–28px).

Title, big number, tiny subtext line.

Use dummy values now; must bind later from real user.

4) Tab bar (directly under KPI row)

Centered segmented control style with pill-highlight on active tab:

Overview (default)

Speaking Events

Content Studio

Earnings

Tabs must be fully functional (client-state or subroutes like /speakers/dashboard?tab=events is fine).

5) OVERVIEW tab (match Base44)

Two equal-width cards side-by-side:

A) Quick Actions

4 action tiles with icon + label (grid 2×2):

View Calendar

Create Content

View Earnings

Manage Profile

Click targets:

Calendar → /speakers/calendar (placeholder)

Create Content → /speakers/content/new

View Earnings → switch to Earnings tab

Manage Profile → /speakers/settings

B) Recent Activity

List items with small blue status dot, title, and light gray timestamp.

Use 4 placeholder activities like Base44; replace later with real feed.

6) SPEAKING EVENTS tab (match Base44)

Section title: Upcoming Speaking Events (H2 weight).

Right of title: small badge “{n} scheduled” (dummy now).

Event cards list (3 sample rows now), each card includes:

Left icon (calendar/building style in violet badge).

Event title (bold)

Host / Institution (subline)

Small pill tags (date icon + date, then virtual OR in-person)

Right side: price in green (e.g., $2,500) and Details button (eye icon).

Bottom full-width CTA: View All Bookings (primary).

Replace the current “empty state” with the full list UI (with dummy rows). When there are truly no events, show the empty state message centered, styled to match the rest.

7) CONTENT STUDIO tab (match Base44)

Section title: Content Performance

Right side top: “Create New” button (primary + plus icon) → /speakers/content/new

Three large stat panels (equal width on desktop, stack on mobile):

Total Content (light blue panel)

Total Views (soft green panel)

Content Revenue (soft purple panel)

Below stats: centered “Ready to Share Your Expertise?” panel with a Start Creating Content button that also routes to /speakers/content/new.

All numbers are dummy and must update when real data is connected.

8) EARNINGS tab (match Base44)

Section title: Earnings Overview

Two main panels at the top:

Total Earnings (This Month) — large green tile with big dollar amount

+% vs Last Month (Growth) — gradient blue tile with % value and small “Growth” badge

Transactions summary list below (sample two rows):

Speaking – {Institution}
Subtitle: Session name (e.g., “Sports Marketing Guest Lecture”)
Right: +$2,500 in green and date

Content Sales – {Product}
Subtitle: e.g., “Digital Marketing Playbook”
Right: +$340 and date range

Footer CTA: View Detailed Analytics (primary). Route to /speakers/earnings/analytics (placeholder OK).

9) Dummy data & wiring

Keep all data placeholders: they must later hydrate from the logged-in Industry Pro account (revenue, content, events, activity).

Buttons and links must navigate; where a real page doesn’t exist yet, use stub routes/components with a simple placeholder card.

Maintain consistent font sizes, paddings, shadows, and hover states across all new elements (use the same tokens your app uses elsewhere).

10) Accessibility & responsiveness

Ensure keyboard focus styles on all interactive elements.

Mobile: sidebar collapses to an icon rail or hamburger; KPI cards stack; lists become single-column with preserved spacing.

Important: Apply all of the above in one edit. Do not break into separate edits. Replace the current speaker preview dashboard UI with this unified version.
