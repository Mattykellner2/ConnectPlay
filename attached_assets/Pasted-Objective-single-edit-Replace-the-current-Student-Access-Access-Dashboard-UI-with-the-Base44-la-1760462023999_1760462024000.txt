Objective (single edit): Replace the current Student Access “Access Dashboard” UI with the Base44 layout and interactions. Keep all data as placeholders that will later hydrate from the student’s account & cohort. The temporary demo access code 1234 should work for now, but the system must be ready for unique per-school/per-cohort codes.

1) Routing & guard

Route: /students/dashboard (redirect your existing “Access Dashboard” route here).

If a student hasn’t entered a valid code, redirect to /students/enter-code.

For demo only, accept code 1234 and place a comment that production codes are cohort-scoped and institution-scoped.

2) Global layout (match Base44)

Add a left sidebar with two groups:

Quick Access

Home Page

Navigation

Dashboard (active by default)

My Speakers

Content Library

Events

Messages

Speaker Connect

Settings

Sidebar stays sticky; active item has soft background + bold label; all items navigate (create placeholder routes where needed).

3) Top header card (red banner)

At top of main content, create a welcome banner with a dark red gradient, rounded-xl, subtle shadow.

Left cluster:

Avatar circle with student initial (e.g., “A”).

“Welcome back, {student.firstName}!” as H3/H2 weight.

Under it: {institutionName} · {programName} · Class of {gradYear} (all placeholder fields for now).

Right side: light, faint campus watermark icon (decoration only).

4) Blue “Connect with a Speaker” card

Immediately below header: full-width blue callout with:

Title: “Connect with a Speaker”

Short helper text: “Got an access code from a guest lecture? Use it for a priority connection.”

Right-aligned primary button “Enter Speaker Code →”

Opens a modal with an Input and Submit.

For demo: accept 1234, close modal, show success toast “Code applied. You’re connected to this cohort.”
(Leave hook to attach to cohort-specific validation later.)

5) Main content: two columns

Left column: “Upcoming For You”

Card list with each item showing:

Title (e.g., “AMA: Life as an ESPN Producer”)

Host + organization line

Date/time

Right-aligned View button (secondary).

Include two sample items like Base44 and allow more items later (scroll if needed).

Right column: “Recommended For You” & “Sponsored Opportunity”

Recommended For You card:

Thumbnail image

Title (e.g., “Breaking into Sports Marketing”)

Creator line (e.g., “Sarah Chen, ESPN”)

“Watch Now” play overlay on the image.

Sponsored Opportunity card:

Orange gradient, “Sponsored Opportunity” with small Ad pill.

Internship/job listing (company, location).

Short description line or two.

CTA button: “Learn More & Apply”.

All items above use dummy content now; wire to real feeds later.

6) Replace the old student widgets

Remove the KPI tiles row and tab strip from the existing student page.

Keep the Welcome context, but use the new banner + blue callout + two-column content as described.

7) Styling & components

Use the same icon set used site-wide (Lucide or your current set).

Keep Base44 spacing: rounded-xl, soft shadows, consistent paddings, 16/20/24px typographic rhythm.

Button styles:

Primary (solid) for Enter Speaker Code, Watch Now, Learn More & Apply.

Secondary (outline) for View on each event row.

Hover/focus states on all interactive elements; ensure keyboard navigation works.

8) Data & future wiring

All data shown = placeholders.

Prepare props/state for:

student.firstName, institutionName, programName, gradYear

recommendedContent[], upcomingEvents[], sponsored[]

enterSpeakerCode(code) → today accepts 1234, tomorrow validates per-cohort.

Leave TODO comments where backend hooks will attach.

9) Responsiveness

On tablet/mobile:

Sidebar collapses to a menu button (or icon rail).

Right column stacks under the left; maintain card spacing.

Banner height reduces; text wraps cleanly.

Important: Apply all changes above in one edit to minimize AI usage. Do not split into separate edits.
