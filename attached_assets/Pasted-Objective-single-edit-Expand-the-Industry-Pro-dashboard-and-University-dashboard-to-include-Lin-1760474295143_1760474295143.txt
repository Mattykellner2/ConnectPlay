Objective (single edit):
Expand the Industry Pro dashboard and University dashboard to include:

LinkedIn quick setup for industry pros.

Networking & Guest Speaking toggles that dynamically hide/show related features.

Public visibility of “Open to Networking” and “Guest Speaking” status.

Speaking engagement tracking + leaderboard & rewards system.

Professor-level accounts nested inside University accounts with tailored permissions.
Keep everything as placeholder logic now (demo mode), wired for backend later. Do all below in one edit to minimize AI credit use.

A) INDUSTRY PRO DASHBOARD ENHANCEMENTS
A1) Quick Setup with LinkedIn

Add to onboarding & settings:

Feature:

A button: “🔗 Quick Setup with LinkedIn”

On click → simulate OAuth connection (for demo, use “LinkedIn connected ✅”).

Pulls:

Name

Title

Company

Profile image

Summary headline

Auto-fills fields in profile.

Add Edit and Refresh buttons to update manually or sync again.

Data object:

pro.linkedin = {
  connected: boolean,
  profileUrl?: string,
  lastSync?: string,
  autoFillData?: { title: string; org: string; photoUrl: string; summary: string }
};

A2) Open to Networking Toggle

In Settings, add switch:

Open to Networking [ ON | OFF ]
“Control whether students can connect with you.”

Behavior:

When ON:

Student side can see “Connect” button on pro profile.

Student can submit connection requests.

When OFF:

All networking features for that pro disappear on the student side.

“Connect” button hidden, replaced by: “This speaker is not currently open to networking.”

On backend:

pro.networkingOpen = boolean;


Filter out pros where networkingOpen === false in all student searches.

A3) Guest Speaking Toggle

In Settings, add another switch:

Guest Speaking Availability [ ON | OFF ]
“Allow universities to invite you for guest lectures or panels.”

Behavior:

When ON:

“Invite to Speak” & “Book Event” options appear on university/professor dashboards.

Appears as “Guest Speaking: ✅ Enabled” on the pro’s public profile card.

When OFF:

Hide all event-related actions on student/university dashboards.

Show: “Guest Speaking: 🚫 Not accepting invitations.”

Set pro.guestSpeaking = boolean;.

A4) Public Display (Networking & Speaking Status)

Visible tags under every Industry Pro’s name across platform:

🟢 “Open to Networking” / 🔴 “Networking Closed”

🟢 “Guest Speaking Active” / 🔴 “Guest Speaking Closed”

These auto-update with toggles from Settings.

A5) Speaking Engagement Tracker + Leaderboard

Add to Dashboard → Speaking Events tab:

Monthly Tracker Section:

“Speaking Engagements This Month” counter (placeholder count).

“Lifetime Total” stat.

“Top Speakers Leaderboard” (shows 10 pros with most engagements in past 30 days).

Leaderboard fields:

Rank	Name	Events this month	Reward Status
1	Dr. Emily Carter	5	🏆 $100 Gift Card
2	Marcus Johnson	4	—
3	Sarah Chen	3	—

Logic placeholder:

const monthlyEngagements = countEventsThisMonth(pro.id);
const leaderboard = getTopSpeakers(10);


Reward:
Top 3 each month → mark rewardGranted: true (for demo, static text “🏆 Reward: $100 Gift Card”).
Add “Redeem Reward” button (nonfunctional placeholder).

B) UNIVERSITY DASHBOARD UPGRADES
B1) Professor Tab / Accounts

Create two account levels within a university org:

a. University Admin

Access: All students, all professors, all analytics.

Tabs:

Overview

Students

Professors

Analytics

Manage Speakers / Invitations

Settings

Can manage and invite professors; view total engagement stats and student participation.

b. Professor Account

Each university professor has:

Login under same university org.

Can see only their own classes, their own speakers, and their own stats.

Professor Dashboard Includes:

My Classes (list of classes assigned)

My Speakers (connected industry pros)

Student Participation Analytics (connections, content views, event attendance)

Requests/Invites (outstanding guest speaker invitations)

Leaderboard view (professor-only) showing their class engagement ranking

Data model additions:

type Professor = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  department: string;
  universityId: string;
  classes: string[];
  speakers: string[];
  analytics?: { totalConnections: number; totalEventsHosted: number };
};

type UniversityAdmin = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  universityName: string;
  professors: Professor[];
  students: Student[];
  analytics: { totalConnections: number; totalSpeakers: number; eventsThisMonth: number };
};


Professor Dashboard Layout:

Left sidebar identical to all dashboards (Home Page + Navigation).

Main cards:

“Active Classes”

“Speakers Connected”

“Student Engagement This Month”

“Upcoming Events”

Buttons: Invite Speaker, View Class Analytics.

B2) Professor View under University Admin

When the admin opens “Professors” tab:

Displays a table of all professors:
| Professor | Department | Classes | Speakers | Engagement Score |

Clicking a professor opens their dedicated sub-dashboard (read-only for admin).

B3) Connection Mapping (University ↔ Professor ↔ Student ↔ Pro)

Flow:

Admin assigns professors to classes.

Professors see their own students + invited speakers.

Students tied to those professors see only those relevant industry pros and events.

Visual summary for each professor (Admin view):

“Dr. Jennifer Martinez – 3 Classes, 5 Guest Speakers, 12 Student Connections, 2 Events Hosted This Month”

C) SYSTEM-WIDE INTERACTIVITY RULES
C1) Dynamic Feature Toggles

All toggles must hide/show respective UI sections instantly (no refresh needed).

Toggle	Impact on UI
Networking OFF	Hides all “Connect” buttons & networking tabs from students.
Guest Speaking OFF	Hides “Book Event,” “Invite to Speak,” and removes from Leaderboard tracking.
Networking ON	Restores all connect-related UI instantly.
Guest Speaking ON	Restores speaking-related tabs & leaderboard participation.
C2) Display Everywhere

Each Industry Pro Profile Card should display:

Avatar + name

Company/title

🟢 or 🔴 icons for both toggles

“View Profile” → shows LinkedIn-connected info if available.

C3) Quick Access Everywhere

Sidebar always includes “🏠 Home Page” link at top.

Clicking “Home Page” = returns to respective role dashboard (Student, Pro, Professor, Admin).

C4) Notifications (placeholders)

When Pro toggles OFF networking → notify all pending students “{pro} is no longer open to networking.”

When Guest Speaking OFF → remove open event invitations and notify universities.

Professors get notified when one of their invited speakers changes availability.

C5) Monthly Reset

At the start of each month:

Reset leaderboard counts.

Generate “Top Speakers” reward list.

Archive past leaderboard as “Hall of Fame.”

D) RESPONSIVENESS & DESIGN

Shared aesthetic = Base44 style (rounded-xl, soft shadows, modular cards).

Sidebar persistent on desktop; collapses to top-nav menu on mobile.

Icons 20px, accessible focus states, readable at 14–16px body text.

Consistent gradient styling (red for headers, blue for calls-to-action, purple for metrics).

E) PLACEHOLDER DATA HOOKS
toggleNetworking(proId: string, status: boolean);
toggleGuestSpeaking(proId: string, status: boolean);
syncLinkedIn(proId: string);
trackSpeakingEvent(proId: string, eventId: string);
getMonthlyLeaderboard(): Leaderboard[];


✅ Apply everything above in one single edit.
All names, stats, and numbers are dummy placeholders.
This structure should support rapid backend integration, minimize AI token usage, and future-proof the dashboard for both Industry Pros and Universities (Admins + Professors).
